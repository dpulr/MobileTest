# Mobile Test.
# Daniel Rodrigo Pulgar√≠n Rojas 

For the test architecture I decided to make use of a builder type pattern that would allow me to create objects and call them wherever necessary taking into account the structure of the data, in the same way I made a MVVM that helps me to structure the way the classes interact, the interface was based on the typical use of storyboards in which views, tables, cells and buttons were implemented, they were connected by classes to the models created for the objects needed.


# Instalation
You must run the file "DRPR Mobile Tech Test.xcodeproject" this supports devices with iOS 14+ so to test the development must be installed on a simulator or device granting the necessary permissions.
